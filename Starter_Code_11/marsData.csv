Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 
Answer:  Month 6 (June) has the lowest atmospheric pressure on mars.
	 Month 9 (September) has the highest atmospheric pressure on mars.


About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? 
Answer:  From the days between the coldest point in 2014 to the coldest point in 2016 (the difference between the two coldest points in the graph), 
	 there are roughly 726 days apart. This shows a martian year is roughly 726 days apart.
	 

To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature of each observation.
